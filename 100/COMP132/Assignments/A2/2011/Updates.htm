<b>Q</b><BLOCKQUOTE class="question">
Does this assignment only require the assumption that we are asking for a regular hexagon?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>A</b><br>
For this assignment we can assume a hexagon be regular with all sides equal size.
So in your program, you need to input only one number for a hexagon, the length of a side.
<p>

<b>Q</b><BLOCKQUOTE class="question">
With "a geometric figure must provide a constructor that takes a Scanner object as a parameter",
I am assuming this is to take input from the user for each shape?
From that wouldn't that then require re-writing the code to take input                                                                        
from users for each shape?   
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>A</b><br>
Yes, in your program every constructor will need to process user's input and ask for entry
appropriate for each shape.
The purpose of the assignment is to isolate common part of the classess and implement them as
efficiently as possible.  If more than one class in the hierarchy share the same fields,
they should probably be defined in their parent class.  You can use abstract classess, interfaces
or normal classess, whatever you think is more appropriate.
You should also provide validation of the inputs through mutators, so to avoid
repetition of the code.
<p>

<b>Q</b><BLOCKQUOTE class="question">
Do we assume that all triangles entered are equilateral (all sides equal)?  If not what properties do we need to record?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>A</b><br>
No, a rectangle should not assume any particular shape.
Your program should ask for three numbers, for example lengths of its sides.
Note, that you can validate if the sides indeed can form a triangle.
<p>

<b>Q</b><BLOCKQUOTE class="question">
I am just wondering if there is a way to tell the program to look for a constructor with parameters?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>A</b><br>
There are some rules regarding super classes and subclasses and how the constructors are called and where.
You do not need no-arg constructors if you are consistent with your implementation.
Creating new scanner objects in your program has its drawbacks, as, unlike to C++, the objects are disconnected.
Each of them will have its own input buffer and then some strange things can happen.

Review Chapter 11 (Calling the Superclass Constructor), they talk about constructors in situations like ours.
<p>

<b>A - more</b><br>
You do need more than one constructor implemented for the superclasses, that will be instantiated.
There are two such cases in the hierarchy of the classes on the diagram.
In your program you should call a constructor with Scanner parameter only once per the shape you are creating.
You can either have a no-arg constructor for Rectangle (for example), or explicitly call another constructor with parameters,
that would initialise its attributes.
<p>


<b>Q</b><BLOCKQUOTE class="question">
How to store the entries in the list?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>A</b><br>
The shapes should be stored in a list of <code>GeometricFigure</code> objects.
Here we use polymorphism.
