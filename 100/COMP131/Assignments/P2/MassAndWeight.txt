1. Create a Scanner object for keyboard input

2. Declare two double variables: mass, weight

3. Prompt the user to input a number for the object's mass

4. Read in the number and store it in the variable mass

5. Calculate the object's weight with the formula:
   weight = mass x 9.8

6. Use logical operator to check range and display results
	(a) If weight >= 20 AND weight <= 2000, output weight to 
		println method
	(b) Else if weight < 20, output "the object is too light" to 
		println method
	(c) Else, output "the object is too heavy" to println method
