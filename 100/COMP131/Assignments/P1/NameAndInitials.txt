1. Declare three String variables: firstName, middleName, lastName

2  Store my first, middle and last names in these variables
   If no middle name, store "NA" in the middleName variable
   
3. Declare three char variables: firstInitial, middleInitial and lastInitial

4. Store my first, middle and last initials in these variables
   If no middle name, store " " in the middleInitial variable
   
5. Use logical operator to display results 
   (a) If middleName is "NA":
       (i)  Output firstName and lastName to println method 
       (ii) Output firstInitial and lastInitial to println method 
   (b) Else
       (i)  Output firstName, middleName and lastName to println method
       (ii) Output firstInitial, middlelastInitial and lastInitial to println method
